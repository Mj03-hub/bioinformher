To investigate the evolutionary conservation of the Hemoglobin Beta (HBB) gene, I first retrieved the human HBB gene sequence from NCBI and then used BLAST to identify HBB sequences from five other species, including chimpanzee, cow, mouse, chicken, and zebrafish. After downloading the FASTA format of these sequences, I created a table showing species name, accession number, and percentage identity with human HBB. Next, I performed pairwise alignments of human HBB with a closely related species (chimpanzee) and a distantly related species (zebrafish) using  EMBOSS Needle , reporting percentage identity, similarity, number of gaps, and interpreting the results. I then conducted a multiple sequence alignment of all six sequences using Clustal Omega, highlighting highly conserved regions, and generated a sequence logo using Skylign to visualize conserved amino acids. Finally, I constructed a phylogenetic tree using MEGA X and interpreted the evolutionary relationships between species based on HBB, comparing them to expected evolutionary relationships.# bioinformher
